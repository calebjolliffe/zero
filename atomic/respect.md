# Disrespect yourself, disrespect everyone

Lately I've been reflecting on self-deprecation and the effects it's had in my life. Based on my actions and what I've observed around me, I've come to a sobering realization:

> Disrespecting yourself means disrespecting everyone around you.

Throughout my adult life, I've struggled to take care of my physical and mental wellbeing. It's the biggest way I've inadvertently disrespected others. When I saw the damage I was doing to myself, I also saw the damage I was doing to others. I'm now taking serious measures to correct it.

My "simple" excuses reinforced negative beliefs about my body, identity, and capabilities. Worse yet, my excuses also told my partner things like:

- "I am uncommitted to myself."
- "I do not value myself."
- " ___ is more important than my health."
- "Becoming my best self is unimportant."
- "It's acceptable to treat me in this way."

It wasn't my intention, but that was what was on display for others—imagine how it got interpreted.

This is not who I want to be to others.

I deserve respect, and I need to show it to myself. It's up to me to set the new foundation for respect in my life. I no longer hold space for directing negativity towards myself.

If I want to be a good person to be around, it's on me to take the first steps.
