# App as Vehicle
At the end of 2023, inspired by Steph Ango's [file over app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app) philosophy, I began taking control of my digital life.

> If you want your writing to still be readable on a computer from the 2060s or 2160s, it's important that your notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s.

I ditched proprietary platforms in favour of something much simpler: plaintext. Every device can read and edit it.

By choosing simpler formats, I become less dependent on companies' platforms. I no longer need 17 flavours of JavaScript to reference an article I saved, or check items off my grocery list. Often, I don't even need internet- I save PDFs and screenshots for later. I now enjoy intentional offline time, and it's become my favourite part of the day.

The apps I use now are vehicles for opening files. Currently, my main vehicle is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I enjoy its simple UI, file-reading capabilities, and its devoted community. I know the tools I use won't last forever, and I don't need them to. My plaintext files will be fine in whatever tool comes next.

## Tools of choice:
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- [Helix Editor](https://helix-editor.com)
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
